# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  **Your answer:**
    A function is a piece of code that is defined and can then be called any number of times. It can accept inputs, and always returns *something*. It lets you reuse code and is especially helpful when you want to iterate over a large amount of information.

  **Researched answer:**
   A function is a block of code that is defined using a name and optional parameters. It is later called/invoked, and at that point is is run, using any arguments that are pass into it. It usually does stuff with this input, but its primary task should not depend on the input. It always returns something, even if it's undefined. Functions help organize code, allow for easier testing and modification, and allow for those code blocks to be reused.



### 2. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  **Your answer:** a parameter is a placeholder of values that the function expects as inputs when it is called. An argument is the actual value that is passed to the function when it is called.

  **Researched answer:** parameters are the placeholders that are defined at the same time the function is created and are local variables available only to the function. arguments are values that are passed to the function at the time it is called. parameters are assigned the values of the new arguments each time the function is called.



### 3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  **Your answer:** an index is a specific location on an array where we can find an element.

  **Researched answer:** an index is the location of a an element within an array and can be used to modifify the values located at the index.



### 4. What is a built-in method?

  **Your answer:** they are functions specific to data types in javascript that come included with the language, so we get to partake of their convenience.

  **Researched answer:** javascript strings, numbers, arrays, etc. are built-in javascript objects. these objects have built-in functions that are available for them to use. these are built-in methods.



### 5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  **Your answer:** a driver and a navigator work on the same problem using the same codebase. The driver is the one who is directly making changes to the terminal, with the navigator describing the process outloud and focusing on the larger context.

  **Researched answer:** Pair programming is when two programmers work together on the same challenge using the came codebase. The driver focuses on the more specific and direct processes (the actual typing, the syntax), while the navigator focuses on the larger direction (e.g. the place of the specific function the driver is typing out within the whole program). It's one person focusing on the finer details while one focuses on the larger picture.



### 6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  **Your answer:** I haven't had a chance to speak with everyone, so the check-ins/outs are a cool way to get to know people before we work together on a project. being able to head back into the main room during pair programming if we have questions is also helpful.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. **Iteration:** running over a piece of code over and over again, through a loop or recursive function (or something else?)

2. **Higher Order Functions:** functions that work with other functions. I've seen functions that take in order functions as parameters, but they can apparently return functions as well.

3. **Jest:** a testing framework for javascript.

4. **Classes:** blueprints or templates we define and then use to create objects.

5. **React:** a front-end library we can use to create reusable components.
